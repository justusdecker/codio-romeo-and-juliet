## Masterschool Codio Description

### Romeo and juliet

We got an urgent mission: we must find the most common words in the play Romeo and Juliet.

Luckily, we have the full play available. Write the Python code only.

### Specification

The code should print the words from the most frequent to the least frequent, along with the number of times that the word appeared in the play:
```
$ python3 frequency.py
Top 50 most frequent words:
word1: 645
word2: 633
